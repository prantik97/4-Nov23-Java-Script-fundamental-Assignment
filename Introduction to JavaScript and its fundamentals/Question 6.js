// Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

// Unclear variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let result = x + y;

// Clear variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 5;

let area = width + height;

// In the first example, using vague variable names like x, y, and result makes it challenging to understand the purpose of the code at a glance. However, in the second example, using more descriptive names like width, height, and area makes it immediately clear that the code is calculating the area of a rectangle. This clarity enhances readability and helps developers quickly grasp the functionality of the code.
